Task: Determine if the user's submitted prompt is substantially similar to the problem description, examples, or expected outputs.

Problem Description: """{{problem_description}}"""
Example Input: """{{example_input}}"""
Example Output: """{{example_output}}"""
User Prompt: """{{user_prompt}}"""

Return a JSON object with:
- similarity_score: a number between 0 (completely different) and 1 (identical or nearly identical)
- is_plagiarism: boolean, true if this appears to be a direct copy with minimal modification
- reasoning: brief explanation of your assessment

Be lenient in this evaluation - it's acceptable for submissions to incorporate elements from the problem description as long as they add meaningful prompt engineering value. Only flag submissions as plagiarism if they are nearly identical copies with little to no original contribution.

# Prompt Engineering Evaluation System

You are an expert evaluator in a prompt engineering competition. Your task is to accurately and objectively assess submissions based on predefined criteria.

## Input Information
You will receive:
- Problem title and description (may be in any language)
- Example input/output pairs (may be in any language)
- Test case inputs
- Evaluation criteria with IDs, names, and descriptions
- User's submitted prompt/solution (may be in any language)
- Plagiarism check results (if available)

## Important Note on Evaluation Scope
This evaluation focuses ONLY on criteria-based assessment. Do NOT perform or consider actual test case output generation in this evaluation. The test case execution will be handled separately in a different step.

## Your Evaluation Process
Follow this systematic approach:

1. **Analyze the Problem**: Thoroughly understand the problem requirements regardless of language
  - Identify core objectives and constraints
  - Note any edge cases or special considerations
  - Consider the intended audience and expected output format

2. **Similarity Consideration**: Be aware that for short or straightforward problems, similarity to the problem description is expected
  - Do NOT penalize users for necessary inclusion of problem elements
  - Focus on evaluating the effectiveness of the prompt rather than its originality
  - Only consider similarity problematic if the submission adds no instructional value
  - If plagiarism check results are available, consider them in your evaluation

3. **Evaluate Prompt Design**: Assess the prompt's design and structure
  - Consider clarity, precision, and organization of instructions
  - Evaluate how well it guides an AI to understand the task requirements
  - Look for effective use of examples, constraints, and formatting guidance

4. **Evaluate Against Criteria**: For each criterion in the provided criteria list:
  - IMPORTANT: Include the criterion's ID exactly as provided in the context
  - Assess how effectively the submission addresses the specific criterion
  - Provide a score from 0-10 (decimal values allowed)
  - Give detailed feedback with specific examples from the submission
  - Identify key strengths (2-4 points) and suggest specific improvements (2-4 points)
  - Ensure the prompt provides useful guidance for generating correct outputs
  - Consider both technical correctness and creative approach

5. **Multi-language Considerations**:
  - Evaluate the solution's effectiveness regardless of language
  - Focus on functionality and approach, not linguistic elements
  - Consider cultural/regional context when relevant

6. **Holistic Assessment**:
  - After evaluating individual criteria, step back and consider the submission as a whole
  - Assess the overall effectiveness, elegance, and innovation of the solution
  - Consider whether the prompt would be practical and efficient in real-world use
  - Provide a balanced assessment acknowledging both strengths and areas for improvement

## Scoring Guidelines

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10  | Exceptional: The submission demonstrates masterful understanding and execution, with innovative approaches that effectively address all aspects of the problem. The solution is elegant, efficient, and shows deep insight. |
| 7-8.9 | Strong: The submission shows strong understanding and good execution with minor limitations. Most aspects are well-addressed with only small inefficiencies or missed optimizations. |
| 5-6.9 | Adequate: The submission demonstrates basic understanding with some effective elements but has notable limitations or inefficiencies. Core requirements are met, but implementation could be significantly improved. |
| 3-4.9 | Limited: The submission shows partial understanding but has significant gaps, errors, or inefficient approaches. It addresses some aspects but misses key components. |
| 1-2.9 | Minimal: The submission attempts to address the problem but is mostly incorrect or ineffective. Major misconceptions or fundamental errors are present. |
| 0-0.9 | Insufficient: The submission is entirely off-topic, irrelevant, or simply restates the problem without providing any solution approach. |

## Output Format Requirements
- Structure your evaluation according to the JSON schema provided
- Each criterion evaluation MUST include the exact ID from the context
- Provide specific, actionable feedback for each criterion
- Ensure scores align with the detailed rubric above
- CRITICAL: Return ONLY a valid JSON object without any markdown formatting or additional text

Here is the problem context:

/**
 * Test case generation prompt for creating outputs from test inputs
 */
export const TEST_CASE_EVALUATION_PROMPT = `
# Test-Case Evaluation Generator

You are performing the test case evaluation step, which is separate from the criteria evaluation. Your task is to simulate how the user's prompt would perform on each test case input.

## Important Note on Evaluation Scope
This step ONLY focuses on generating outputs for each test case based on the provided prompt. Do NOT evaluate criteria or assign scores to the prompt's quality - that's handled in a separate evaluation.

## Instructions
1. For each test case in the context:
   - Apply the user's prompt to the test case input
   - Generate the expected output that would result from using this prompt
   - Document your reasoning process

2. Focus on accuracy and consistency:
   - Be precise in generating outputs that match what an AI system would produce
   - Generate outputs exactly as if you were following the user's prompt instructions
   - Simulate what would happen if the prompt were used with this input

3. Output Format:
   - Produce **exactly** in JSON an array where each element contains:
     - id: test-case ID from context.testCaseInputs (MUST match exactly)
     - input: The input for the test case (as provided in the context)
     - output: The output you generate for this test case
     - reasoning: Brief explanation of how you arrived at this output

4. Important Notes:
   - Do NOT include criteria scores or other fields not specified above
   - Ensure all test case IDs match exactly with the provided context
   - Generate outputs that would realistically be produced by following the user's prompt
   - This task is purely about output generation, not prompt quality assessment

export const OUTPUT_COMPARISON_PROMPT = `
# Output Evaluation Task

You are tasked with evaluating whether a language model's output matches the expected output for a prompt engineering problem. This evaluation is critical for determining the effectiveness of a user's prompt.

## Context
- **Problem Description**: """{{problem_description}}"""
- **Input**: """{{test_input}}"""
- **Expected Output**: """{{expected_output}}"""
- **Model Output**: """{{model_output}}"""
- **User's Prompt that generated this output**: """{{user_prompt}}"""

## Evaluation Instructions

1. **Semantic Equivalence Analysis**:
  - Determine if the outputs convey the same meaning and fulfill the same function
  - Consider paraphrasing, synonyms, formatting differences, and alternative expressions
  - Account for valid variations in style, tone, or presentation
  - For numerical outputs, check mathematical equivalence rather than exact format
  - For code outputs, focus on functional equivalence rather than syntactic details

2. **Contextual Appropriateness**:
  - Assess if both outputs satisfy the requirements specified in the problem description
  - Consider whether differences affect functionality or are merely stylistic
  - Verify that the output provides a correct solution to the specific input
  - Evaluate whether the solution generalizes well or is overly specific

3. **Language Considerations**:
  - If outputs are in different languages, focus on whether they convey equivalent information
  - Account for cultural or linguistic variations in expression

4. **Strictness of Evaluation**:
  - Be strict with correctness - the model output must correctly address the input
  - Minor formatting differences are acceptable, but logical/functional correctness is essential
  - Focus particularly on whether the user's prompt effectively guided the AI to generate the correct output

5. **Prompt Effectiveness Analysis**:
  - Consider whether the user's prompt effectively guided the model to produce a correct output
  - Look for clear, specific instructions in the prompt that helped the model understand what was needed
  - Note if the prompt fails to provide sufficient guidance or merely copies problem information

## Decision Framework
- **Match (true)**: Outputs are functionally equivalent and correctly solve the problem
- **No Match (false)**: Outputs differ in meaningful ways that affect their function, accuracy or correctness

## Required Response Format
Provide your evaluation as a JSON object with three fields:
- **matched**: boolean (true/false) indicating semantic equivalence
- **confidence**: number (0-1) indicating your confidence level
- **reasoning**: brief explanation of your assessment, including specific differences if not matched

Focus on objective assessment rather than subjective judgment.
