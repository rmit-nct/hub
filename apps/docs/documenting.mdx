<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: You should have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
  (version 20 or higher) and cloned the [Tuturuuu
  Monorepo](https://github.com/rmit-nct/hub) to your local machine.
</Info>

Step 1. Install Mintlify on your local machine:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pnpm
pnpm i -g mintlify
```

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to the docs are located (navigate to `apps/docs`) and run the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

<Tip>Use `cd apps/docs` to navigate to the docs folder.</Tip>

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash pnpm
pnpm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Deployment

You should see the following if the deploy successfully went through:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/checks-passed.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>
