### Real-time Synchronization

```typescript
// Real-time score updates and leaderboard
const gameChannel = supabase
  .channel(`neo-crush-game-${gameId}`)
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: 'INSERT',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'game_scores',
    },
    (payload) => {
      updateLeaderboard(payload.new);
    }
  )
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: 'UPDATE',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'neo_crush_games',
      filter: `id=eq.${gameId}`,
    },
    (payload) => {
      updateGameState(payload.new);
    }
  )
  .subscribe();
```

### Match Detection Algorithm

```typescript
// Detect matches in the game grid
function findMatches(grid: Gem[][], minLength: number = 3): Match[] {
  const matches: Match[] = [];

  // Check horizontal matches
  for (let row = 0; row < grid.length; row++) {
    for (let col = 0; col < grid[row].length - minLength + 1; col++) {
      const color = grid[row][col].color;
      let matchLength = 1;

      while (
        col + matchLength < grid[row].length &&
        grid[row][col + matchLength].color === color
      ) {
        matchLength++;
      }

      if (matchLength >= minLength) {
        matches.push({
          type: 'horizontal',
          row,
          startCol: col,
          length: matchLength,
          color,
        });
      }
    }
  }

  // Check vertical matches (similar logic)
  // ...

  return matches;
}
```
