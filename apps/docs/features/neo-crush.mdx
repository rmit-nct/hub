## Usage

To play Neo Crush, start a new game from the Neo menu. Swap adjacent fruits to form a line of 3 or more of the same color. Matches score points and new fruits cascade into the board.

## Saved Games

If you are signed in, your game state and best scores can be saved. This lets you resume later and track personal bests over time.

## Game Management

Anyone with access to the device/session can continue the current run. You may reset the board or start a new run at any time from the game menu.

Only share your device with people you trust if you care about preserving a run or a high score.

## Limitations

- Gameplay is single‑player only right now
- No server‑side anti‑cheat yet
- Scores persist per browser unless cleared
