## Where it lives

- Path: `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(games)/neo-chess`
- Key files:
  - `page.tsx` – route entry
  - `chessboard.tsx` – board rendering
  - `piece.tsx` – piece component
  - `pieceSetup.ts` – initial setup
  - `promotion.tsx` – pawn promotion UI
  - `referee.ts` – move validation / checkmate logic

## How to run

```bash
bun sb:start # if not running
cd apps/web
bun dev
