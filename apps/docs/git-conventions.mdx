## Overview

Tuturuuu follows standardized conventions for Git commits and branch naming to improve collaboration, automate releases, and maintain a clean, navigable repository history. We use two main specifications:

1. [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for structured commit messages
2. [Conventional Branch](https://conventional-branch.github.io/) for consistent branch naming

These conventions help automate our CI/CD workflows, generate changelogs, and make our development process more efficient.

## Conventional Commits

### What are Conventional Commits?

Conventional Commits is a specification for adding human and machine-readable meaning to commit messages. It provides a set of rules for creating an explicit commit history, making it easier to write automated tools on top of.

The basic structure of a conventional commit is:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

Tuturuuu uses the following commit types:

| Type       | Description                                     | Example                                          |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `feat`     | New feature or enhancement                      | `feat: add dark mode support`                    |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                         | `fix: prevent crash when user data is undefined` |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes                           | `docs: update installation instructions`         |
| `style`    | Code style changes (formatting, no code change) | `style: format code with prettier`               |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring                                | `refactor: simplify authentication logic`        |
| `perf`     | Performance improvements                        | `perf: optimize database queries`                |
| `test`     | Add or fix tests                                | `test: add unit tests for auth middleware`       |
| `build`    | Changes affecting build system or dependencies  | `build: update dependency to fix security issue` |
| `ci`       | Changes to CI configuration files and scripts   | `ci: add workflow for staging deployments`       |
| `chore`    | Routine tasks, maintenance                      | `chore: update package.json metadata`            |

### Scopes

Scopes provide additional context about which part of the codebase is affected. In our monorepo structure, we often use package or app names as scopes:

```
feat(web): add new dashboard layout
fix(ui): correct button alignment in mobile view
chore(types): update supabase database types
```

### Breaking Changes

Breaking changes must be indicated by adding a `!` after the type/scope or by using a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer:

```
feat(api)!: require authentication for all endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: All API endpoints now require authentication tokens.
```

### Examples

Here are some examples of conventional commits used in our codebase:

```
feat(web): add new calendar integration
fix(supabase): correct permission issue in auth policy
docs(readme): update development setup instructions
style: apply consistent formatting with prettier
refactor(utils): simplify date formatting functions
perf(queries): optimize workspace user loading
test(auth): add tests for token verification
build(deps): update Next.js to v14
ci(vercel): add automatic preview deployments
chore(release): publish packages
```

## Conventional Branches

### What are Conventional Branches?

Conventional Branch refers to a structured naming convention for Git branches that makes it easier to identify branches by type and purpose.

The basic structure is:

```
<type>/<description>
```

### Branch Types

Tuturuuu uses the following branch types:

| Type      | Description             | Example                         |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `main`    | Main development branch | `main`                          |
| `feature` | For new features        | `feature/user-dashboard`        |
| `bugfix`  | For bug fixes           | `bugfix/login-error`            |
| `hotfix`  | For urgent fixes        | `hotfix/security-vulnerability` |
| `release` | For preparing releases  | `release/v1.2.0`                |
| `chore`   | For maintenance tasks   | `chore/update-dependencies`     |

### Naming Rules

1. Use lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens
2. Keep names concise but descriptive
3. Include ticket/issue numbers when applicable
4. Avoid special characters (except hyphens)

### Examples

```
feature/workspace-sharing
bugfix/file-upload-error
hotfix/auth-vulnerability
release/v2.5.0
chore/update-react-18
feature/issue-123-user-profile
```

## How These Conventions Improve Our Workflow

### 1. Automated Changelog Generation

Our conventional commits are used to automatically generate changelogs for releases. Different commit types are categorized accordingly:

```markdown
# Changelog

## Features

- add dark mode support (#123)
- add calendar integration (#124)

## Bug Fixes

- prevent crash when user data is undefined (#125)

## Documentation

- update installation instructions (#126)
```

### 2. Semantic Versioning

Conventional commits help determine the next semantic version for packages:

- `fix:` commits trigger a PATCH increment (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
- `feat:` commits trigger a MINOR increment (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
- Commits with `BREAKING CHANGE` trigger a MAJOR increment (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)

### 3. Automated Package Publishing

In our CI workflows, package publishing is automatically triggered when a PR with specific commit types is merged. For example, our `release-types-package.yaml` workflow triggers when:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]
    paths:
      - 'packages/types/package.json'
  # ...

jobs:
  check-version-bump:
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true && contains(github.event.pull_request.title, 'chore(@tuturuuu/types)')
    # ...
```

### 4. Better Code Reviews

With conventional commits and branches, it's easier to understand the purpose of a pull request at a glance:

- A PR from `feature/user-dashboard` with commits like `feat: add user stats widget` clearly indicates a new feature
- A PR from `bugfix/auth-issue` with commits like `fix: prevent token expiration error` indicates a bug fix

### 5. Simplifying Navigation

Conventional branch names make it easier to navigate the repository history and find specific changes. For example:

```bash
# Find all feature branches
git branch --list "feature/*"

# Find branches related to authentication
git branch --list "*auth*"
```

## Tools and Enforcement

We use a dedicated CI/CD check to enforce our Git conventions:

### Branch Naming Check

We use a GitHub Action workflow to verify that branch names follow our convention:

```yaml
name: Branch Name Check

on:
  push:
    branches-ignore:
      - main
      - production

jobs:
  check-branch-name:
    name: Check branch name
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check branch name
        run: |
          BRANCH_NAME=${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/}
          if ! [[ $BRANCH_NAME =~ ^(feature|bugfix|hotfix|release|chore)/.+ ]]; then
            echo "❌ Branch name '$BRANCH_NAME' doesn't follow the conventional branch format."
            echo "Branch name should be in format: type/description"
            echo "Allowed types: feature, bugfix, hotfix, release, chore"
            exit 1
          else
            echo "✅ Branch name follows convention: $BRANCH_NAME"
          fi
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Good Commit Messages

1. Use the imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
2. Capitalize the first letter of the description
3. Do not end the description with a period
4. Keep the description under 72 characters
5. Use the body to explain the what and why, not the how

Example of a well-formatted commit:

```
feat(auth): Add multi-factor authentication support

Implement TOTP-based multi-factor authentication to improve security.
The implementation follows the RFC 6238 standard.

Closes #123
```

### Branch Management

1. Create branches from the latest `main` branch
2. Keep branches focused on a single task or issue
3. Regularly rebase long-lived branches on `main` to avoid merge conflicts
4. Delete branches after they've been merged

### Pull Request Workflow

1. Create a branch with the appropriate type based on the work
2. Make commits using conventional commit messages
3. Push the branch and create a pull request
4. Use conventional commit style for the PR title
5. After approval and merge, delete the branch

## Conclusion

Following these Git conventions helps us maintain a clean, understandable repository history, automate release processes, and improve collaboration across the team. By standardizing both commit messages and branch names, we create a more efficient development workflow.
