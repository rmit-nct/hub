## Fallback Responses

A fallback response is what the model returns when the prompt or generated content activates a safety mechanism. A common fallback message might be: "I'm sorry, but I can't help with that."

If you encounter a fallback response, try raising the temperature setting to encourage a different outcome.

## Cautionary Notes

- Avoid using the model as a reliable source for factual information.
- Be cautious when using it for math or logic-related tasks, as the output may not always be accurate.
