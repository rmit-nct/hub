title: 'Include Relevant Context'
description: 'Add background details, references, or brand-specific data to help the model generate more targeted responses.'
---

Don‚Äôt assume the model knows everything it needs. Instead, add helpful background details or instructions directly in the prompt. Supplying context gives the model a better understanding of your goals, limitations, and the specific problem it needs to solve.

For example, the following prompt asks the model to provide router troubleshooting advice:

**Example Prompt:**

```prompt
My printer won‚Äôt print even though it‚Äôs connected. The display says ‚ÄúPaper Jam‚Äù, but I checked and there‚Äôs no paper stuck inside. What should I do?
```

**Response:**

```response
If your printer shows a ‚ÄúPaper Jam‚Äù error but there‚Äôs no visible jam, it could be due to a false sensor trigger or small bits of paper stuck inside. Here are steps you can take to troubleshoot:
1. Power off and unplug the printer.
2. Open all accessible panels and trays.
  - Remove any paper and carefully check inside using a flashlight.
  - Look for tiny scraps of paper or dust near rollers or sensors.
3. Clean the rollers.
  - Use a lint-free cloth slightly dampened with water to clean the feed rollers.
4. Let it rest for a few minutes, then restart.
   - Plug the printer back in and turn it on.
5. Try a test print.
  - If the issue persists, consult the printer‚Äôs manual or support site for advanced help.
```

The response provided sounds like general advice and doesn‚Äôt directly address this specific printer model or its error message behavior. To make the response more accurate and relevant, you could include details from the printer‚Äôs official troubleshooting guide‚Äîsuch as how it handles ‚ÄúPaper Jam‚Äù alerts or what might trigger them falsely. Providing that context helps the model give targeted, brand-specific instructions rather than just standard tips.

**üìù Summary:**

- Add any relevant background or reference material directly into the prompt to guide the model‚Äôs response.
- Also, be sure to clearly explain how the model should apply that context when generating its answer.
